<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ACTIVATION">ACTIVATION FLAT -1 OR -2 POINTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A power with this flaw requires an action to prepare or activate before any of its effects are
usable. If the power requires a move action to activate, the flaw is -1 point. If it requires a standard action, it is
-2 points. Activation taking less than a move action is not a flaw, although may qualify as a complication (see the
<b>Power Loss</b> complication for details). Whenever the power (or group) is deactivated it goes through <b>Power
Loss</b> (although usually ammunition is not affected).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Activation has no effect other than making the power or group's effects available for use. The
effects themselves still require their normal actions to use. You can use a power's effects in the same turn as you
activate it, provided you have sufficient actions to do so. If the power is deactivated--either voluntarily or
involuntarily via effects like Nullify--you must activate it again in order to use any of its effects not to be confused
with ending an effect's duration. A device may have this modifier to represent a requirement to first turn the device
on.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Activation applies to an entire power and all of its effects. Activating the power brings all
of its effects "online" and makes them available. If you have to activate different effects separately, apply this flaw
to each of them, requiring separate actions for each.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If Activation is not automatic, apply the Check Required flaw to the entire power as well and
have the player make the necessary check in order to activate the power. If the check fails, the power does not
activate, and the character has to take the activation action to try again.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ACTIVATION-AND-PERMANENT-EFFECTS">ACTIVATION AND PERMANENT EFFECTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The Activation flaw does allow permanent effects that are part of a power to be turned off, but
only if the power as a whole is deactivated. It does not affect the other aspects of permanent duration, including the
inability to improve the effect with extra effort. The GM should decide if allowing a permanent effect to have an
Activation is appropriate based on the specific effect and any others it is combined with in the power.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Stonewall has the power to turn into a super-strong
rock-form. This is a combination of the Enhanced Strength, Impervious Protection, and Power-Lifting effects. Stonewall's
player applies the Activation flaw to the power, saying Stonewall has to concentrate and take a standard action to assume
his rock-form. That reduces the total cost of all three effects by 2 character points (not 2 points each for 6 points)
and means unless Stonewall takes a standard action to activate his rock-form, he cannot use any of the power's effects,
even including permanent ones like Protection.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ALTERNATE-EFFECT">ALTERNATE EFFECT FLAT -? (-1/2) POINTS</h3>
<div class="generated-class-42">
<div class="generated-class-1">Under the Hood: Choosing Alternate Effects</div>
<div style="padding:10px;background-color:#F4CCCC">
<div style="padding:5px">Arrays--collections of Alternate Effects--are one of the more complex and important constructs
and require some special care in terms of their creation and use. Players should take these things into account when
creating characters with arrays, and Gamemasters should consider them when approving such characters and dealing with
them in play.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The main reason for the Alternate Effect modifier is to allow a degree of flexibility in terms
of a character's power effects within the cost restrictions laid down by having a finite number of character points.
It's based on the assumption that a wide range of powers has a diminishing return in terms of value, since characters
can only use so many effects at once. A power with various "settings," usable one at a time, is more valuable than a
power with only one, but not as valuable as various effects all usable at the same time.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">However, Alternate Effect can be abused to try and squeeze the most "efficiency" out of a
character's character points, gaining the most effects for the lowest cost. The guidelines for Alternate Effects are
intended to help limit this somewhat, but there is no way they can eliminate the possibility entirely and still provide
all the benefits of flexibility they're intended to offer. Some Gamemaster oversight is therefore necessary when it
comes to the creation and use of arrays.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Before giving a character Alternate Effects, it is wise to ask, "Is an array really needed for
this concept?" Some concepts, such as a variety of different settings of a lazer gun, clearly call for an array. Others,
like a power with a few rarely used stunts, may not call for an array. Such a power may be better served by acquiring
such occasional stunts through extra effort and the spending of victory points rather than the creation of a permanent
set of Alternate Effects. That is what the power stunts rules are for, after all: so you do not have to fill up
character sheets with minor Alternate Effects a hero will rarely ever use.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Alternate Effects must have a good explaination of relation following the same guidelines as a
power stunt. Indeed Alternate Effects are simply power stunts that you buy to avoid extra effort. Although if the
Alternate Effect is used more often than the main effect the GM might require you to pay the full cost of the effect for
it to no longer be alternate.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Alternate Effect can only be applied to effects that could possibly be used at once and
therefore this can generally not be applied to damage, healing, or movement effects since (for example) multiple
damaging effects can never be used at the same time anyway.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If you decide an array is appropriate, the first thing is to determine its overall theme and
associated descriptors. Is it a collection of regular power stunts for a themed power like earth control? And so forth.
Arrays should have some unifying theme beyond "all the powers I want my hero to have" or "they are all powered by my
spellcasting or battlesuit" and Gamemasters should feel free to veto inappropriate arrays lacking a strong theme.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding:5px">This modifier allows you to "swap-out" the effect for an entire other, alternate, effect! For
example, a Damage effect with the descriptor of "laser" might have a visual Dazzle as an Alternate Effect: the same
light beam can be used to damage or blind a target, just not both at once. Think of Alternate Effects as different
"settings" for a power. (For combinations of effects that work simultaneously, see the <b>Linked</b> modifier in this
section.) A set of Alternate Effects is called an <b>array</b>.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">An Alternate Effect can have any rank, or combination of modifiers. Alternate Effects may also
have different descriptors, usually thematically linked, within reason. This allows you to have two versions of a Damage
effect, for example: such as a fire blast and an ice blast. Permanent effects cannot have Alternate Effects, nor can
they be Alternate Effects (since they can't be turned on and off).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">An Alternate Effect can have a total cost in character points no greater than the primary
effect. So a rank 10 primary effect costing 2 points per rank, for a total of 20, can have any Alternate Effect with a
cost of 20 character points or less. This cost does not include the cost of the Alternate Effect modifier itself. So if
the 20-point power has 5 Alternate Effects, each Alternate Effect is still limited to a total value of 20 points
(including any modifiers it may have), that of the base effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">To determine the cost of an Alternate Effect first count how much the effect would normally
cost (this must be less than or equal to the main effect) then divide that by 2 rounded down. For clarity: the point
value of <b>Alternate Effect</b> is rounded down meaning the power total cost is rounded up. For example a power that
would normally cost 3 points as an alternate effect instead costs a total of 2 points.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Like any power, an Alternate Effect may be made up of two or more effects, but their total cost
cannot exceed the cost of the primary effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Alternate Effects cannot be used or maintained at the same time as other Alternates in the same
array; they are mutually exclusive. Switching between Alternates requires first to deactivate (stop maintaining as a
free action) the current power then take whatever action is required for the next effect, this can be done once per
turn. If anything disables, nullifies, or drains any power in an array, all of them are affected in the same way.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-AMMUNITION">AMMUNITION -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A power with this flaw can only be used a certain number of times between reloading. The number
of times must be at least 50% hindering in the same fashion as the Limited rank flaw. Choose how many uses per what time
interval the power has such as 1/day or how many times it can be used until needing to reload such as 5/reload.
Reloading is by default a standard action and by default you have unlimited Ammunition clips to reload with: running out
of clips of Ammunition is a complication. This flaw may be applied again for the number of uses to be reduced to 25%
effectiveness such as 1/(2 weeks). For effects that are not Instant duration instead use a total amount of usage time
such as 20 rounds/day. Also see the rank flaw Fades and complications.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: A gun-toting vigilante, Marksman has a variety
of guns (acquired via the Equipment advantage). Each must be reloaded periodically. He wears a belt of ammunition clips so
that reloading isn't a concern, no matter how many shots he fires or how many thugs he guns down. When, during a long
fire-fight, the Gamemaster decides that Marksman's belt has used up every clip, the player gets a victory point for the
complication, forcing the hero to come up with a new plan, fast!</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-CHECK-REQUIRED">CHECK REQUIRED FLAT -1 POINT PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An effect with this flaw requires a check of some sort--usually a skill check--with a
difficulty class equal to the applications of Check Required. If the check fails, the effect doesn't work, although the action
required to use it is expended (so attempting to activate a standard action effect takes a standard action whether the
check is successful or not).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If the check succeeds, the character gains the use of 1 effect rank per point the check exceeds
the DC. Thus a check result of 14 allows the character to use up to 4 ranks of the effect. If a lesser rank of the
effect doesn't do anything, then it's the same as failing the check.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The required check occurs as part of the action to use the effect and provides no benefit other
than helping to activate it. Normal modifiers apply to the check, and if you are unable to make the required check for
any reason, the effect doesn't work.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A critical success or critical failure can still occur normally on this check. So there is
always a small chance the effect won't work, regardless of the character's check bonus.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">This check must be in addition to any check(s) normally required for the effect. So, for
example, the normal perception check made in conjunction with a sensory effect does not count as an application of this
flaw, and applying it means an additional check is required before the effect's normally required check(s).</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: A spellcaster has Senses 4 (Detect Magic,
Ranged, Acute, Analyze) with Expertise: Magic Check Required 4. The player needs to make a DC 4 skill check
to successfully cast the spell, followed by the normal Perception check to pick up on anything present, and perhaps
another Expertise check to interpret what the character senses.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">CHECK EXAMPLES</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Skill checks an effect may require include:</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Acrobatics</b>: Suitable for effects requiring a measure of coordination or complex
maneuvering.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Deception</b>: Good for effects intended to deceive, particularly sensory effects like
Concealment or Illusion, and disguise or form-altering effects like Morph.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Expertise</b>: An Expertise skill check might represent having to know something about the
subject of the effect or having to know something about the effect itself.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Intimidation</b>: Useful for effects intended to inspire fear as well as similar offensive
effects like Affliction.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Stealth</b>: Best suited to sensory effects, particularly Concealment.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Technology</b>: Operating a complex device may require a Technology check.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DECREASED-DURATION">DECREASED DURATION -1 COST PER RANK PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The duration for an effect is grouped in order as follows: Permanent, Continuous, Sustained,
then Concentration. See <b>Duration</b> for details. This modifier decreases an effect's duration from left to right.
Each duration decrease cost -1 except going from Permanent to Continuous which is +1 therefore going from Permanent to
Sustained is free. Effects that have a base duration of Instant can't have their durations changed. Also see
<b>Increased Duration</b> modifier.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3">Going from Permanent to Sustained</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A permanent duration effect that becomes sustained duration now requires a free action to use
(rather than none, like other permanent effects). The benefit is the sustained effect can be improved using extra
effort, including using it to perform power stunts. The drawback is the effect requires a free action during each of your turns to
maintain it, and being unable to do so means the effect shuts off.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: The Protection effect is permanent by default,
meaning it always protects the character, but concentrating or trying harder does not make the effect more protective, nor
can the character use it for power stunts. Sustained Protection can be turned on and off, improved with extra effort, and
used for power stunts. It might represent a power like a personal force field, or increased density requiring a modicum
of concentration to maintain.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DIMINISHED-RANGE">DIMINISHED RANGE FLAT -1 POINT</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Diminished Range reduces the effect's short, medium, and long ranges. This flaw reduces the
effect's short range by 1 distance rank keeping in mind that medium range is 1 more than short range and long range is 2
more than short range so that the 3 distances are 15 ft, 30 ft, and 60 ft. This flaw can't be applied again, for that
use Reduced Range to change the effect from ranged to close range (although the active resistance changes from dodge to parry).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DISTRACTING">DISTRACTING -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Using a Distracting effect requires more concentration than usual, causing you become
vulnerable when you use the effect, until the start of your next turn. After that point you are no
longer vulnerable and if the power has a duration other than instant you may continue to use the power without being
vulnerable. The power's duarion doesn't need to be concentration. This flaw can be applied to Instant effects as well as
lasting ones but not Permanent since they are never activated.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-FADES">FADES -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Each time you use an effect with this flaw, it loses 1 rank of effectiveness. For effects with
a duration longer than instant, each round is considered "one use." Once the effect reaches 0 ranks, it stops working. A
faded effect can be "recovered" in some fashion, such as recharging, rest, repair, reloading, and so forth. The GM
decides when and how a faded effect recovers, but it should generally occur outside of combat and take at least an
hour's time. The GM may allow a hero to recover a faded effect immediately and completely by spending a victory
point.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-FEEDBACK">FEEDBACK -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You suffer damage when a manifestation of your effect is damaged. This flaw only applies to
effects with physical (or apparently physical) manifestations, such as Create, Illusion, or Summon, for example. But it
may also be applied to any power if the descriptor contains something physical, such as using Nano-bots or is
Flight with the Platform flaw. If your power's manifestation is damaged, make a resistance check
against the attack's damage rank, using your effect's rank as the resistance check bonus. For example, if a
manifestation of a rank 10 effect is attacked for damage 12, you must make a resistance check against damage 12 with a
+10 bonus (the effect's rank) in place of your normal Toughness.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-FRAGILE">FRAGILE FLAT -? (-2 - 1 per application see below) POINTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">This can only be applied to a device, that is to say that the effect must first have the
removable flaw. This flaw subtracts 1 flat point for every 1 point of toughness it loses (see material toughness table
in <a href="../effects/damage-attack.html#TOC-DAMAGING-OBJECTS">Damage: Damaging Objects</a>)
and an addition flat 2 point reduction for having the same limitations
as equipment (see <a href="../../gadgets-gear/index.html#TOC-EQUIPMENT">Gadgets &amp; Gear: Equipment</a>).
The additional 2 points are not optional meaning this flaw is always
worth at least 2 points. Fragile can't reduce a device's Toughness to less then 0. Note that equipment has both
removable and fragile and is so cheap is due to it being commonly available for any citizen with exceptions for
government regulations on weapons and technology availability.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-GRAB-BASED">GRAB-BASED -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An attack effect with this flaw requires you to successfully grab a target before using the
effect (see <b>Grab</b>). This generally applies to an effect that is close range, since grab by default is close range
anyway. The effect's range must be within range while you are grabbing. If you do not succeed on the grab, you cannot
use the effect. If your grab attempt succeeds, the effect occurs automatically as a reaction.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Leech has a draining touch that is a Grab-Based
Weaken Strength effect. So the monstrous villain has to take a standard action and make a grab first in order to use it.
If his close attack check hits, the target makes a Dodge or Fortitude resistance check against Leech's Strength. If it
fails, the target then makes the Fortitude resistance check against the villain's Weaken effect to see how much Strength
Leech drains away.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">This flaw is essentially a form of Resistible, with a grab check rather than a regular
resistance check (see the <b>Resistible</b> flaw for more).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-INACCURATE">INACCURATE FLAT -1 POINT PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An effect with this flaw is hard to control or wildly inaccurate. Each application gives you a
-2 penalty to attack checks with the effect.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-LIMITED">LIMITED -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An effect with this flaw is not effective all the time. Limited powers generally break down
into two types: those usable only in certain situations and those usable only on certain things. For example Only While
Singing Loudly, Only While Flying, Only on Men (or Women), Only Against Fire, Not Usable on Yellow Things, and so forth.
As a general rule, the effect must lose about half its usefulness to qualify for this modifier. Anything that is
effective more than half the time is better handled as an occasional complication. This flaw can be applied again if an
effect is only about 25% as effective. Also see <b>Unreliable</b>.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-PARTIALLY-LIMITED">PARTIALLY LIMITED</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">If your effect is only somewhat effective in particular circumstances, apply the flaw to only
some of its ranks. For example, an attack effect that does less damage against targets with Protection (to represent a
diminished ability to penetrate armor, for example) applies the Limited flaw to only those ranks that are
ineffective.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-NOTICEABLE">NOTICEABLE FLAT -1 POINT</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A continuous or permanent effect with this modifier is noticeable in some sort of way (see
<b>Noticing Power Effects</b>). Choose a noticeable display for the effect. For example Noticeable Protection may take
the form of armored plates or a tough, leathery-looking hide, making it clear the character is tougher than
normal.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-QUIRK">QUIRK FLAT -1 POINT PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">A Quirk is some minor nuisance attached to an effect, essentially the reverse of a Feature (see
<b>Feature</b> under <b>Extras</b>). A Quirk is generally worth, at most, 2-3 character points, and many are simply
1-point flaws.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">As with Features, the GM should ensure a Quirk is truly a flaw (albeit a minor one) and not
simply part of the power's descriptors. For example, the fact that an attack with a "sonic" descriptor likely will not
travel through a vacuum is not a Quirk, simply part of the "sonic" descriptor (especially since the attack may be
enhanced by a medium such as water). On the other hand, a shapeshifter unable to change color (losing some of the
power's utility), or a telepath unable to lie while using Mental Communication, do have Quirks to their powers.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The GM sets the rank (and therefore value) of any given Quirk for an effect, based on how
troublesome it may be, similar to setting ranks for the Benefit advantage and Feature effect (see those trait
descriptions for details). Having multiple quirks is possible but should not sum up to more than 5.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-REDUCED-RANGE">REDUCED RANGE -1 COST PER RANK PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An effect has a range of perception, ranged, or close in decreasing order. Decreasing an
effect's range by one step (from ranged to close, for example) is worth -1 cost per rank but going from Perception to
Ranged is worth -2. So that going from Perception to Close is worth a total of -3. Effects that are close range can't
further decrease their range to personal instead see <b>Side Effect</b>.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-REMOVABLE">REMOVABLE FLAT -? (-1/5 or -2/5 see below) POINTS</h3>
<div class="generated-class-42">
<div class="generated-class-1">Under the Hood: Removable And Equipment</div>
<div style="padding:10px;background-color:#F4CCCC">
<div style="padding:5px">Items provided by the Equipment advantage (see <b>Advantages</b>) are essentially effects and
other traits with Easily Removable and Fragile, along with the various other limitations outlined in the <a
href="../../gadgets-gear/index.html">Gadgets &amp; Gear</a> so that the Equipment advantage provides 5 points worth of
equipment per rank (or 1 character point) despite the fact that removable can never reduce an effect below 1 point.
Although weapons and armor cost 1/5 of the price.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Effects with this flaw can be "taken away" from you, removing your access to the effects until
you regain it. Typically, this means a power that resides in an object, called a <b>device</b>, which someone else can
remove. There are two different versions of this flaw covered in the following paragraphs; the first is <b>Removable</b>
and the second is <b>Easily Removable</b>.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A removable power may only be removed when you are both stunned and defenseless, essentially
unable to resist, and cannot be removed during action time. This means opponents can generally only remove the power
after defeating you (leaving you incapacitated) or through some sort of scheme outside of a conflict, such as a plot to
break into your headquarters and steal a device kept there, for example.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">An easily removable power can be taken away with a disarm or grab action (see <a
href="../../action-adventure.html">Action &amp; Adventure</a>). This typically represents a hand-held device (such as a
weapon, magic wand, remote control, or the like) or some worn item easily snatched from you, like a hat or cloak.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-REMOVABLE-POINT-VALUE">POINT VALUE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Removable applies to the power as a whole and not individual effects, although it may apply to
a power with only one effect. The flaw is worth -1 point (-2 points for Easily Removable) per 5 total character points
of the power's final cost, after applying extras and flaws to its effects. Meaning that an easily removable 99 point group
will cost a total of 60 (see following example). Because this modifier applies to a group its value is determined after
<b>Alternate Effect</b>. The flaw value is always rounded down since it occurs every 5 points only. However for easily
removable you should multiply by 2/5 then round down so that 4 points easily removable becomes 3 points.
Technically easily removable is -1 point per 2.5 total character points.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Mistress Marine's armor provides Veronica
with a number of effects, including Damage, Enhanced Strength, Flight, Protection, and Senses. The total character point
cost of all the armors effects is 99 points, including extras and flaws applied to those effects. Dividing the total cost
by 5 is 19.8 which becomes 19 after rounding down. So the Removable flaw reduces the cost of the Mistress Marines armor by
19 points, from 99
to 80 character points. However the armor can be taken away, disabled, and so forth, and the player receives no victory points
for a complication when it happens due to the nature of the flaw.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: Harry Potter has a wand which has 99 points
worth of powers. It is easily removable (it can be disarmed in combat) so to find it's point value first multiply
99 by 2 which is 198 then divide by 5 which is 39.6 which rounds down to 39. This means that the easily removable
flaw reduces the total cost by 39, from 99 to 60.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-REMOVABLE-AND-DAMAGE">DAMAGE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Removable devices can be damaged, possibly even destroyed (see <b>Damage</b> effect description
for details). So long as the character has character points invested in the device, it can be repaired, eventually. This
usually requires time between adventures, perhaps even a special adventure to find certain rare parts, specialized help,
or other components.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Devices have a base Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided by 5 (rounded
down, minimum of 1). This base Toughness is counted before removable and fragile are applied.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-REMOVABLE-AND-COMPLICATIONS">COMPLICATIONS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The temporary loss of a removable power does not constitute a complication, any more than the
result of any other flaw. You can have a device or power-object as a descriptor without this flaw, if you wish, in which
case the power cannot be removed or taken away from you without a complication applied by the GM (earning you a victory
point) or the use of an effect like Nullify, which has predefined conditions for recovery.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-RESISTIBLE">RESISTIBLE -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">When applied to an effect that doesn't normally allow a resistance check, this flaw gives it
one. Choose the defense when the flaw is applied. Since effects that work on others allow a resistance check by
definition, this nearly always applies to personal effects that allow someone interacting with them to circumvent the
effect with a successful check. The DC for the resistance is equal to power rank whether for a skill or defense check, the
skill used must be possible to perform untrained.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">For example, an Enhanced Parry defense effect might reflect a low-level reading of a target's
mind to anticipate and avoid attacks. It allows a Will resistance check to overcome the effect, denying you the defense
bonus against that opponent (and applying this flaw to the effect). Likewise, your Concealment effect might be illusory
rather than a true physical transformation, permitting an Insight (Awe) skill check for someone to overcome it. A
sustained Protection effect might be some sort of "kinetic field" that permits an attacker a Fortitude resistance check
to overcome it.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">When applied to an effect that does normally allow a resistance check, this flaw gives it an
additional one, which may be the same as its normal resistance, or different. The target makes both resistance checks
and applies the better of the two to determine the effect's result.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">For example, a Weaken effect based on a poison dart might add a Toughness check to see if the
dart penetrates the target's skin in addition to making the usual Fortitude check against the effect and the Dodge check
due to being a ranged effect the order of them is Dodge, Toughness then Fortitude.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SENSE-DEPENDENT">SENSE-DEPENDENT -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The target of a Sense-Dependent effect must be able to perceive the effect for it to work. This
can't be applied to personal range effects because you can always sense yourself and therefore isn't a limitation
(instead see <b>complications</b>). The target gets a Dodge resistance check. Success means the target has managed to
avert his eyes, cover his ears, etc. and the effect doesn't work. Otherwise the effect works normally and the target
makes the usual resistance check against it, if any. Some senses can't be averted such as tactile in which case this
flaw is worth nothing and many exotic senses in which case this flaw is worth even more.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Opponents aware of a Sense-Dependent effect can also deliberately block the targeted sense:
looking away, covering or blocking their ears, etc. This provides a +2 bonus to resistance checks against the effect,
but gives others partial concealment from that sense. An opponent unable to use a sense (blind, deaf, etc.) is immune to
effects dependent on it. Opponents can do this by closing their eyes, wearing ear- or nose-plugs, or using another
effect like Concealment. This gives you total concealment from that sense.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Sensory effects are Sense-Dependent by definition, and cannot apply this flaw. To give a target
additional resistance to a sensory effect, use the Resistible flaw.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SIDE-EFFECT">SIDE EFFECT -1 OR -2 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Failing to successfully use an effect with this flaw causes some problematic effect. Failure
includes missing an attack check, or the target successfully resisting the effect. If the side effect always occurs when
you use the effect, whether you succeed or fail, it is worth -2 cost per rank.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The exact nature of the side effect is for you and the Gamemaster to determine. As a general
guideline, it should be an effect about the same in value as the effect with this flaw. So an effect with a cost of 20
points should have a 20-point side effect. Typical side effects include Affliction, Damage, Weaken, or maybe Nullify.
The Side Effect does not require an attack check and only affects you, although the GM may permit some Side Effects with
the Area modifier on a case-by-case basis. You get a normal resistance check against the Side Effect. If you are immune
to your own powers, you aren't immune to its side-effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The GM may also allow a Complication Side Effect, which essentially imposes a complication on
you without awarding a victory point. See <b>Complications</b> for more information.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SLOWER-ACTION">SLOWER ACTION -1 COST PER RANK PER APPLICATION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The action type for an effect is grouped as follows from fastest to slowest: Triggered,
Reaction, Free, Move, Standard, Full, and Slow. Each application slows down the action from that effect's action type
(free to move, for example) and is worth -1 cost per rank. Permanent effects have an action type listed as None which
can't be modified. See <a href="../../action-adventure.html#TOC-ACTION-TYPES">Action &amp; Adventure: Action Types</a> for a full description of each type.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SYSTEM-DEPENDENT">SYSTEM DEPENDENT FLAT -2 POINTS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The System Dependent effect must be able to enter the target's system for it to work. Such as
inhalation, eating, skin contact, injection, etc. Thus a character with a closed system is immune to it as long as their
system remain closed. A closed system specifically is referring to Immunity but effects with this modifier can also be
avoided by holding breath or not eating etc.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-TIRING">TIRING -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An effect with this flaw causes you to suffer a level of fatigue when you use it. You recover
from this fatigue normally, and can spend a victory point to overcome it at any time.
In essence, the power requires extra effort in order to use it (see <b>Extra
Effort</b>). This makes Tiring a useful flaw for creating an effect you can only use with extra effort.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Tiring is often applied to just some ranks of an effect to represent a higher level of the
effect, usable only through extra effort. For example, a hero might have a rank 12 Damage effect, but routinely use only
8 ranks of it. The remaining 4 ranks are Tiring, so using them quickly fatigues the hero.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A Tiring effect can be combined with extra effort, but the fatigue stacks, causing a minimum of
two levels of fatigue per use.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-UNCONTROLLABLE-ACTIVATION">UNCONTROLLABLE ACTIVATION -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You have no control over when an effect activates. This can only be applied to an effect that
has Triggered action. The trigger conditions must be assigned when the power is taken and can't be changed except during
point reallocation (which requires the Gamemaster's permission). The power can't be activated by choice and you can't
stop it from activating when the conditions are met. Like all flaws that change cost per rank it must be 50% limiting.
The fact that it can't be activated on demand is generally enough to be worth the cost. But, for example, Damage
triggered by saying the phrase "Judgement Strike" has virtually no downside as it can be activated whenever you like and won't
accidentally occur, this is better handled as a complication or a quirk.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-UNCONTROLLABLE-ENTIRELY">UNCONTROLLABLE ENTIRELY -5 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You have no control over an effect with this flaw. Instead, the Gamemaster decides when and how
it works (essentially making it a plot device). This flaw is best suited for mysterious powers out of the characters'
direct control or effects the GM feels more comfortable having under direct, rather than player, control. You can no
longer even choose to activate it, this is very cheap since the GM can cause spontaneous effects anyway. The GM controls
every aspect of it: activation, duration, target, etc.</div>
<div style="padding:5px;margin-left:40px;font-style:italic"><b>Example</b>: The great sorcerer Abraham Lincoln has a magic talisman
that gives him advice of what to do next however he can't seem to activate it and only receives advice from it when he is
really stumped or going in a completely wrong direction.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-UNCONTROLLABLE-RESULT">UNCONTROLLABLE RESULT -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The result is random, this only applies to powers with variable results such as
<b>Illusion</b>, <b>Create</b>, and variable <b>Summon</b>. This is difficult at best to do randomly so the GM will
decide how to handle what happens. An example would be choosing to use Illusion and who it targets but not what they
see, this is fitting for hallucinations. For Create and Variable Summon you choose to activate it (and the location if
applicable) but the GM chooses what exactly is created or summoned.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-UNCONTROLLABLE-TARGET">UNCONTROLLABLE TARGET -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You can't control what the effect targets to some extent. This can't be applied to personal
range effects, ones with the <b>Selective</b> modifier, or ones that affect an <b>Area</b>. All characters who are
within the effect's range and that you can accurately perceive, including yourself and allies, have an equal chance of
being the effect's target.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">For another application of this flaw instead of targeting a random character the effect targets
a random square on the map that is within range and that you can accurately perceive for a total of -2 cost per rank.
Every square, including your own, has an equal chance of being the target and if that square contains a character (being
on the other side of an invisible wall is out of range unless the effect is perception ranged) then that character is
targeted otherwise it targets whatever is in that square: objects, the ground, air, etc.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">In either case it is recommended that the GM rolls dice or has some way of determining the
result randomly. And if the target is invalid, such as effects that can't target yourself or targeting an object and you
can't affect objects, then the effect is countered.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-UNRELIABLE">UNRELIABLE -1 COST PER RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">An Unreliable effect doesn't work all the time. Randomly determine if the effect functions each
round before you use or maintain the effect, including continuous and permanent durations. Either flip a coin or roll a
single Fudge die having the effect function on positive or heads, and it doesn't work on tails or negative (reroll 0).
Even if the effect fails to work you've still used the action the effect requires. Spending a victory point on your
reliability roll allows you to succeed automatically (since the roll is then at least a 1).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Roll when first activating the effect and each time you maintain it. If you fail the duration
ends as normal and you must take the normal action needed to activate the effect again. If you fail the roll when you
first activate the power instead the effect is countered. You are aware that you effect's duration ends and continuing
to concentrate would be pointless without first reactivating it. If you fail the roll with a permanent duration effect
it is considered countered until your next turn. Permanent effects use no action and will reactivate even if you can't
take any actions.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">For another application the effect is only 25% reliable requiring the functional check twice
each round. Powers that are only occasionally unreliable (less than about 50% of the time) are better handled as
complications (see <b>Complications</b>).</div>
