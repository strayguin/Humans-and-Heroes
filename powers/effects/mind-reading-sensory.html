<div style="padding:5px">You can read another character's mind. To use Mind Reading, make an opposed power check against
the result of the target's Will check. The degree of success determines the degree of contact:</div>

<td>1</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><b>Surface thoughts</b>: You can read what the target is presently thinking. Mind Reading
transcends language; you comprehend the target's thoughts whether or not you share a common language. This also allows you
to perceive what they are sensing, such as seeing through their eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td style="text-align:left"><b>Personal thoughts</b>: You can probe deeper into the target's mind for information. You can
essentially ask any one question and receive the answer from the target's mind. If the target doesn't know the answer, then
you know that as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><b>Memory</b>: You can read the subject's memories and recollections. This allows you to perceive
them exactly as the target recalls them, one memory per round.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td style="text-align:left"><b>Subconscious</b>: You can read memories from the target's subconscious, things even the target
does not consciously know. This might mean repressed or hidden memories, deep-seated psychological traumas, or even
other personalities.</td>
</tr>

<div style="padding:5px">If you lose the opposed check, you cannot read the target's mind. With two or more degrees of
failure, any renewed attempt in that scene requires extra effort (see <b>Extra Effort</b>). If you desire a greater
degree of contact, you must take another standard action and make a new opposed check.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The target gets a new Will check (DC equal to Mind Reading rank) at the end of each turn to shut
you out; success ends the effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If you get more than 1 degree of success you may still read minds as though you had a lower
degree, so that with 3 degrees of success you can choose to read Surface thoughts instead of memories.
Additionally you may read at multiple levels in the same turn so long as the degrees add up.
For example with 5 degrees of success you can read some Surface thoughts and memories in the same turn. How much
information you can get per turn should be greater than talking, since thinking is faster, but the limit is still
determined by the Gamemaster.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-MIND-READING-AND-DECEPTION">MIND READING AND DECEPTION</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">If you can interact with your subject, a successful Deception check against the target's
Insight check causes the subject to consciously think about a particular piece of information you're looking for, such
as a password or name, allowing you to pluck it from the subject's mind with surface thoughts contact.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SELF-MIND-READING">SELF MIND READING</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">You may use mind reading on yourself in order to perfectly recall a memory or view your
subconscious (you already know your own surface and personal thoughts perfectly). You must roll a power check to
represent that using mind reading on yourself is difficult to do with a DC of 0. If you read your own Surface thoughts
you will get feedback causing a headache as an <a href="affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a>: dazed, staggered, then
asleep with rank equal to your <b>Mind Reading</b> rank. You can only recall memories that have been established as
being known and thus you can't use this to pass knowledge checks (only memory checks) see skills for details.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Cumulative</b>: Your Mind Reading adds any further degrees of success to the existing degree
on the target, rather than using just the result of the new opposed check. For example, if you have one degree of
contact and make another Mind Reading check, getting one degree, you now have two degrees of contact. <b>+1 cost per
rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Effortless</b>: Trying again after two or more degrees of failure does not require extra
effort for you. You can retry a Mind Reading attempt an unlimited number of times. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Sensory Link</b>: You can "tap into" the senses of your subjects, perceiving what they
perceive like a <a href="remote-sensing-sensory.html">Remote Sensing</a> effect (see <b>Remote Sensing</b>) so long as
you have at least one degree of contact. Your own senses are inactive while you are using your sensory link and you can
only perceive through the senses of one subject at a time. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Subtle</b>: As a mental sensory effect, <b>Mind Reading</b> has a degree of subtlety, only
noticeable to the subject or to characters with an appropriate mental sense, such as Mental Awareness (see <b>Senses</b>
effect). Subtle <b>Mind Reading</b> is less detectable, requiring a DC 10 Perception check for either type of character
to sense it, while two ranks of the Subtle modifier makes your <b>Mind Reading</b> completely undetectable. <b>Flat +1
or 2 points.</b></div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Close</b>: Applied to Ranged Mind Reading, Close <b>Mind Reading</b> requires a close attack
check to touch an unwilling target and physical contact throughout the effect's duration; breaking contact ends the
effect. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Feedback</b>: You suffer Feedback if a subject you are reading is harmed, using your <b>Mind
Reading</b> rank as the resistance check bonus against the damage. Additionally, you may suffer Feedback at the GM's
discretion from reading or experiencing particularly traumatic or emotionally-charged thoughts of memories from the
subject. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Limited by Language</b>: You can only understand the subject's thoughts or memories if you
share a common language. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Limited to Emotions</b>: You can only read or probe for emotions and emotional associations,
not coherent thoughts or memories. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Limited to Sensory Link</b>: If you have the Sensory Link extra and this flaw, you can only
tap into a subject's senses, you cannot read their thoughts or memories. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Limited to Surface Thoughts</b>: You can only read surface thoughts and cannot achieve
higher degrees of contact. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Ranged</b>: Ranged <b>Mind Reading</b> requires a ranged attack check in addition to the
effect's normal resistance check. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Sense-Dependent</b>: Your <b>Mind Reading</b> is dependent on a sense other than just having
to accurately sense the target, such as needing to see his expressions (Sight-Dependent), hear him speak
(Hearing-Dependent), smell his changes in biochemistry (Scent-Dependent), and so forth. Alternately, it may be dependent
on first being in Mental <a href="communication-sensory.html">Communication</a> with the target. <b>-1 cost per
rank.</b></div>
