<div style="padding:5px">You can find the path to anywhere well known to you. If you have the wrong locational
information then the path will lead you where you think it is. When you gain this power choose a sense for the path to
be sensed by. When activating choose a well known location and a path will form from where you are now to your
destination. Only you can sense the path. The path does its best to form such that it is the shortest path that is
possible for you to take (although not necessarily the safest). If there is no possible path then the path will take you
as close as possible and then indicate a dead end. The path updates if your knowledge of where your destination is
changes (correctly or otherwise), if the shortest possible path changes, or if you tell it to change (such as to take a
detour or avoid an obstacle). You know how long the path is but might not be able to sense every detail of it.</div>

for determining location. It might be more useful to simply take these powers separately but if linked you only need a
single action to use both. <b>see <a href="../../effect-descriptions/attain-knowledge-general.html">Attain
