<div style="padding:5px">You can change another character's mind.
To use Mental Transform, make an opposed power check against the result of the target's Will check.
If you lose the opposed check, you cannot change the target's mind. With two or more degrees of failure, any renewed
attempt in that scene requires extra effort (see Extra Effort).
The degree of success determines the degree of possible change:</div>

<div style="padding:5px">If you desire a greater degree of change, you must take another standard action and make a new
opposed check.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Healing Restorative</b> can reverse <b>Mental Transform</b> if the <b>Healing</b> degrees of success is equal to
or greater than the afflicted Mental Transform: it must be removed at once and degrees can't be reduced although
multiple levels of change are each removable separately.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Physical damage that causes mental damage can't change subconscious level but it may destroy
the entire mind effectively killing the character: who is Incapacitated with
0 HP neither can be recovered until <b>Healing Resurrection</b> is used but the body doesn't rot away if taken care of, if not
taken care of the body will starve to bodily death (-3 HP) then start to rot.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A mental <b>Illusion</b> can fake memories and surface thoughts (what is presently being sensed) but
nothing deeper.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Mental Transform can be effectively used as <b>mind control</b>, at a memories level this is more
expensive for the same thing but at Subconscious level
this is much longer lasting.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-NO-MATCH">If subconscious does not match</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The target gets a new Will check (DC equal to Mental Transform rank) each minute to regain their
rightful mind; success ends the effect entirely.
The target is aware that something is not quite right about their mind and because of this they will always attempt the Will check
unless they retain a real memory of why they wanted their mind to be erased. If the victim has not recovered their mind
upon falling asleep (or in another state that causes dreams such as Trance perhaps) they get a single Will check for the entire
duration of this state with a +10 bonus.
If the victim's mind is read the reader will see only what the new memories but will be aware that they have been tampered
with unless the reader can see into the
victim's subconscious which will reveal the correct memories.
If a mind reader reads at a subconscious level then they may give the victim an immediate Will check for mental recovery with
a bonus equal to the mind reader's mind reading power check that was used to read the mind.
A <b>Detect Influence</b> (Awe) skill check can detect a person who is acting differently due to changed memories (the DC is high).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-MATCH">If subconscious matches</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">If the target's subconscious matches the other parts of their mind then the target is no longer
aware of tampering and do not get a Will check every minute but recovery is still possible.
They do not get a Will check while conscious. Recovery is only possible if the victim is at least considering the idea that
their mind may have been changed and enters a dream state getting a single Will check (DC equal to Mental Transform rank) without a bonus.
Where correct memories are stored after the subconscious has been changed is unknown.
If the victim's mind is read the reader will see only what the new memories are, which do appear to be completely natural.
A <b>Detect Influence</b> (Awe) skill check will not longer work but a <b>Sense Mood</b> (Awe) skill check can notice if the victim is feeling
uncertain about their true past.</div>
