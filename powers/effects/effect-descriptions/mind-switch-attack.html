<div class="generated-class-70"><b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Close &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 8 points per rank</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can switch minds with another character. To use Mind Switch the character you target must
not have more total character points than your rank in Mind Switch x5 if the target does then the target is immune to
this power. Otherwise to use Mind Switch, the target makes a Will check +10 vs your ranks in Mind Switch. Both
character's bodies have an ongoing effect so that either of them can be Nullified.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The term "original body" refers to the character's body when it is not under any of the effects
of mind switch even if it is not actually the body the character was born or created with. Brain surgery and construct
tampering can cause a body switch, in which case it can only be reverted by the same process. Insight can't detect a
swapped body unless you detect a lie. Notice how this power always allows a reversal without reapplication because this
is an affliction.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The owner of this power must be able to perform the actions needed to maintain the effect's
duration. This means that the owner always has the option to end the power in addition to the target (if applicable).
Switching back transcends time and space and is a free action, although you might not be aware of when and where your
original body is. Each minute the victim (the affected character who does not own the power) may make the same Will
check +10 again to demand switching back, this passage of time is based on the victim and requires a free action.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">When switching, note that HP, equipment, and all conditions are linked to the body not the
character (mind). When switching, the two characters effectively switch character sheets with exception to the mind:
Intellect, Awareness, Presence, and all associated skills and Advantages remain with the character's mind. This may
cause a character to effectively have more character points than normally allowed however this is only a problem if the
mind switch lasts a "long time" at which point the GM decides how to handle it.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Whichever character switches back in any way (due to being affected by nullify, deciding to end the effect,
being unable to maintain the affect, etc) that character returns to their original body switching with whoever is
currently in that body. Each mind that has been affected by this power is marked with an ongoing effect until it is
returned to its original body by any means. When every mind has returned to their original body the effect duration
ends. This power can't be used again until the each subject is is back within their original body since the previous
during must first end.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Death</b>: in the event a character dies while this effect is ongoing. If a mind is switched
into a dead body then the mind also dies. If a dead mind is switched into a live body then it is brain dead but
otherwise the same. If the mind of the character that owns the power dies and the power is continuous, then the affect
will continue and the dead mind will still be marked with an ongoing effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If you acquire a functional body without a mind (being brain dead or a construct with mind
removed) you may still swap minds with it as though the missing mind existed in the case of switching back the
place-holder mind always fails Will checks and can't maintain effects but is still associated with their original body.
Notice that a lack of a mind uses exactly the same rules as a mind that has died. Any object that can't function as a
body can't be switched with.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">For this power to be within a device it must have Affects Others to function since the device
itself has no mind and is not a suitable body (for that see Constructs). For devices the owner of the power is whoever
is using the device, although either party can always demand the effect to end. A device with this power can't be used
again until each of the two characters are back in their original bodies (or at least what was their body in the case of
death) but remember that if the effect is not continuous it will automatically end if there is no user to maintain
it.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Multiple switching back may occur at the same time in which case it is important to remember
that each are returned to their original body. With the existence of Split, time travel duplicates, and super power
duplicates this power gets complicated fast: the GM has been warned (take notes). The GM decides if and how many
non-traits transfer such as complications and victory points. Having your body stolen should award you with victory
points as a complication.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Automatic Reverse on Death</b>: If a body dies then whichever mind originally owned that
body switches back then dies. The mind that was in that body but did not die becomes Exhausted due to the shock of being
thrown back from death. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Body Stealer</b>: With this modifier switching back can only be done if both bodies are
within the range of this effect. This modifier is very expensive because it makes stealing bodies too easy (if the
stolen body has teleport you'll never see it again). A GM should be wary of players taking this modifier, it exists for
a body-based McGuffin quest and complications. It is also easier to keep track of since the switching back no longer
transcends time and space. <b>+5 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Split</b>: Same as the normal modifier, notice that the body retains each unused rank and
split by default although who owns the power remains the same. It is important to remember that when a duration of this
power ends the mind returns to their original body. <b>Flat 1 point per application.</b></div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">Free Modifiers</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Existence Dependent</b>: Same as the normal modifier but everyone who has been switched by
the power switches back at the same time. Note that this modifier depends on whoever currently owns the power.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Relocate Body</b>: Normally the two bodies stay in place as the minds switch but with this
modifier your character with their new body end up in the same place as before the switch. If you want to be able to
choose when to switch places you need to take it as an alternate effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Third Party</b>: Choose two characters that are within range and switch their minds instead
of switching yours with a single target. If either target resists the effect is countered. If this power is Reversible
then either affected character can choose to end the effect at any time. You always have the option to end the power
because you are the owner. If the Body Stealer extra is also used then both affected characters and the owner must be
within range to switch back. If you are choosing to end the effect you must choose one of the targets to return to their
original body recall that this might not return the other to its original body.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Reversible</b>: Any character may choose to end the power as a free action without the need
for a Will check. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
