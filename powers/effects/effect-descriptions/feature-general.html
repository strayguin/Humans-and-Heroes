<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="effect-general-feature">FEATURE (GENERAL)</h3>
<div class="generated-class-70"><b>Action</b>: None &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Permanent &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point per rank</div>
<div class="generated-class-42">
<div class="generated-class-1">Under the Hood: Feature</div>
<div style="padding:10px;background-color:#F4CCCC">
<div style="padding:5px">The <b>Feature</b> effect is intended to round out various minor traits and abilities
characters might have, but it is entirely optional and not meant to burden character design with needless amounts of
detail. It's for traits with an actual game effect, not merely descriptors or background color (neither of which should
cost any points). Ultimately, the Gamemaster decides what traits merit a rank (or more) of Feature and what Features are
permitted for any given game or setting, using the examples given here.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If a "feature" is something likely to come up only occasionally, or even just once, then you
are better off allowing it as an aspect of the inspiration and power stunt rules (see <b>Characteristics</b>), charging
the player a victory point for the feature when it comes into play. The player can then choose whether or not to use
earned character points to acquire the Feature as a regular part of the character's traits later on.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You have one or more minor features, effects granting you an occasionally useful ability, one
per rank. This effect is essentially a version of the <b>Benefit advantage</b> but a power rather than a virtue of
skill, talent, or social background. For example, diplomatic immunity or wealth are Benefits; fur, the ability to mimic
sounds, or a hidden compartment in your hollow leg are Features.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">It's up to the GM what capabilities qualify as Features; generally, if something has no real
game effect, it's just a descriptor. If it has an actual game system benefit, it may be a Feature. There's no need to
define every possible Feature a character may have down to the last detail.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Some Features may be sustained duration rather than permanent with no change in cost. This
suits active Features a character has to use and maintain rather than having them as passive traits requiring no effort
whatsoever.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Note that some of the example features listed below are actually sample powers (of powers that
aren't feature) that were not important enough to have a dedicated page.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-22" id="TOC-SAMPLE-FEATURES">SAMPLE FEATURES</h3>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Hover</b>: You can hover a maximum distance of 1 foot (distance rank -4) above the ground.
You will still slide down slopped surfaces as though you were standing on them. Your movement is unaffected (ie you walk normal)
and you can still be tripped (by tackling your legs). For only 1 more point you could get <b>Flight</b> instead.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Insulating Fur</b>: This costs 2 points. You have a layer of fur that protects you from
natural heat and cold, giving you immunity to those environments. Note that this is the <b>Immunity</b> power.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Internal Compartment</b>: You can carry a portion of your carrying capacity inside your
body! You have a pouch or compartment of some sort, able to hold objects with a size rank no greater than 3 less than
your own (size -5 for a normal size rank -2 human).</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Iron Stomach</b>: You can eat anything that's not toxic or poisoned without ill effects, no matter how
unpleasant it may be: spoiled or particularly gross or spicy food, for example. You are immune to mundane diseases that
exist in rotten food.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Mimicry</b>: You can imitate almost any sound you've heard, giving you a +10 bonus to
Deception checks to convince others your mimicked sounds are real.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Quick Change</b>: You can change clothes--such as into or out of your costume--as a free
action. With 2 ranks, you can change into any outfit at will.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Special Effect</b>: You have some special effect, like a gust of wind at the right dramatic
moment, or ideal spotlighting, or personal theme music. The GM may give you a +1 bonus for favorable circumstances when
your special effect is likely to impress people or otherwise aid you.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Temporal Inertia</b>: You are somehow uniquely "anchored" in your timeline,
making your memory immune to changes in history. You recall the "true" version of historical events, even if no one else
does. If you are from a different timeline you remember your timeline even if that isn't the main one any more.
Note that this only applies to memories and will not protect you from death or other maladies.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The example features listed here were ones that were short and simple enough to do so.
