<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="effect-control-move-object">MOVE OBJECT (CONTROL)</h3>
<div class="generated-class-70"><b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Ranged &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 2 points per rank</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can move objects at a distance without touching them. Move Object has no action/reaction; a
moving object cannot drag the character "holding on" to it, for example. This effect is also not considered "physical
contact" or "touch" for effects requiring it.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Your effective Strength for lifting and moving objects with this effect is equal to your rank.
By taking a move action to concentrate you can increase this by +1 Str, changing the effect's duration to Concentration
(see <b>Duration</b>). This is in addition to using extra effort to further increase your rank (see <b>Extra
Effort</b>). If the object is relatively weightless such as air, fire, and electricity then instead you can control a
volume rank of that object equal to your effect rank.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">This effect can move objects, but cannot perform tasks of fine manipulation (like untying
knots, typing, or manipulating controls) without the Precise modifier (see extra below). Objects thrown into targets as
attacks base their damage off your power rank as if it were your Strength rank. Accuracy is determined by
the skill Ranged Combat: Throwing (Dex) which is independent from your power rank (although the modifier Accurate can
still be used).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Move Object cannot inflict damage directly; you can't "punch" or "crush" objects with it (for
that see the Damaging extra below). You cannot move yourself with this power because that would be <b>Flight</b> (see
Rule of Exclusive Purpose and the Flying extra below). You can use it to make disarm, grab, and trip attacks. See <a
href="../../../action-adventure.html">Action &amp; Adventure</a> for details.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Continuous</b>: Move Object generally cannot have a continuous duration, since it is an
active effect and requires at least a modicum of attention to maintain. The GM may allow Continuous Move Object as a
variation that is not disrupted when you are unable to maintain it, but that still requires your conscious attention to
do anything other than have the affected object hang in midair. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Damaging</b>: Your effect can inflict damage, like an application of normal Strength with
damage equal to its rank. This includes damaging targets in grabs and making ranged "strike" attacks. <b>+1 cost per
rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Flying</b>: You can now lift yourself with move object. This functions just like the
<b>Flight</b> power with the Platform flaw (see page for more details). Your speed is equal to your effective strength
minus your mass. You do not need this modifier to lift other people. Move Object with this extra still has no
action/reaction it simply allows you to lift yourself. <b>Flat +1 point.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Precise</b>: Move Object with this modifier can be used for tasks involving fine
manipulation. <b>Flat +1 point.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Subtle</b>: The default version of Move Object involves some noticeable manifestation like a
"tractor beam," a glow around your head or hands (along with a corresponding glow around the affected object), big
glowing hands, blazing "energy talons," a lasso, whip, or the like. Apply the Subtle modifier for a less noticeable Move
Object effect, such as invisible "psychokinesis" (which is generally also Perception Range). <b>Flat +1 point per
application.</b></div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Close</b>: Since Move Object works on things at a distance by definition, it cannot
generally be reduced to close ranged. At the GM's discretion, a Close Ranged Move Object effect may represent "tactile
telekinesis" or a supernatural influence over objects you are able to touch, but such things are usually better
represented by the <b>Super-Strength</b> effect. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Concentration</b>: Concentration Move Object requires more attention to maintain. You cannot
concentrate to increase your lifting capacity or to grab or move another object while you are still "holding" your
first. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Limited Direction</b>: You can only move objects in a particular direction or path, such as
only up and down (towards and away from the ground), only directly towards or away from you (attraction and repulsion),
and so forth. This is useful for "gravitic" or "magnetic" versions of the effect. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Limited Material</b>: You can only move a particular type of object or material, such as
only metals, plants, rock, water, and so forth. The GM may allow a second application for a particularly limiting type
of material, such as only precious metals, leaves, sand, or petroleum. <b>-1 cost per rank</b></div>
