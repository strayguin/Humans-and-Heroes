<div class="generated-class-70"><b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Instant &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 2-5 points per rank</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You are able to gain knowledge even if it is normally impossbile to discover by mortal means.
You source of information (as determined by descriptor) will answer correctly and honestly or state that it doesn't
know. It is a good idea to have a source that is nearly omniscient so to reduce the amount that it doesn't know. When
you obtain this power choose one of the following options to determine cost per rank. The first three types (2-4 points
per rank bases) can only determine location however the same model can be used with the Gamemaster's approval if you
want a kind of knowledge that requires some other knowledge as a base. Any location determined is very accurate so much
so that the location is now considered "well-known" to you even if you've never been there. The locational information
is accurate to a 3 foot radius (see Precise modifier for the exact location). The information is not updated during
travel (not even the distance), for that you have to use the power again. The locational information attained provides a
direction, distance, and location name (country, city, address, etc) but not how to get there. You know which direction
was indicated even if you don't know which way is North etc. Although the knowledge does not have a duration you may
forget it as normal.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">When you obtain this power choose one of the following options to determine cost per
rank:</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>2 points</b>: You can locate anything that is well known and any location by name. The
former is used for determining distance, direction, or name for places such as anywhere you've been that you can
remember well or for the place you currently are. The latter (any location by name) is useful for teleporting so that
you can go there by only knowing the name.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>3 points</b>: You can locate either any person by name or any object. The locational
information will tell you the name of where the target is but will not tell you any more about the target such as full
legal name. Since objects are often not unique you will get the location of the closest one that fits the
description.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>4 points</b>: You can locate anything desired. You are not required to know anything about
it and may find things such as "the nearest hero with heat vision" or "the person guilty of this crime".</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>5 points</b>: You gain the answer to any question you ask. No longer limited to location you
may learn anything at all. You do not need to use questions to gain knowledge but that is the standard. How much
information you gain per usage is up to the Gamemaster but it should be worthwhile.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">As noted in the Precognition &amp; Postcognition sidebar in <a
href="senses-sensory.html">Senses</a>, knowledge can easily ruin an adventure and the last two types of attain knowledge
given above (4-5 points per rank bases) are more powerful and more informational than Precognition and Postcognition, so
the Gamemaster may limit your ability to use this power, may not allow you to have it at all, or require some
limitations such as not the last two types or require slow action to use.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Destination Unknown</b>: Can only be applied to 2-4 points per rank bases for determining
locations. The location is still considered to become well known but you know nothing else about it. You know how to
reference the location only if you do so right away (it is easy to forget). You don't know if the location determined is
one you've already been to but you do know if the power fails (is countered) or if your source doesn't know. <b>-1 point
per rank</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Limited to yes/ no questions</b>: Can only be applied to 5 points per rank base. You may
only ask a yes or no question although the answer does not have to be strictly yes or no if the answer doesn't fall
entirely into one of those categories. The answer should be either: "yes", "no", "maybe", "I don't know", or "does not
apply". If it isn't a yes or no question then it automatically doesn't apply if the answer is subjective and could be
seen either way then the answer is maybe. <b>-1 point per rank</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Misinformation</b>: Your source of information is dishonest, doesn't know very much, or is
otherwise unhelpful about half of the time. <b>-1 point per rank</b></div>
</div></div>
