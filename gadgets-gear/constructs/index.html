<div class="page-header-blue">CONSTRUCTS</div>
<div style="font-size:16px">
<div style="padding:5px">Armored robots, humanlike androids, even magically-animated golems or zombies are all examples
of <b>constructs</b>, non-living things capable of acting on their own to one degree or another, carrying out direct
commands or preprogrammed instructions, or even possessing independent thought in some cases.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Constructs are more than devices or equipment since they are capable of action on their own
(rather than just improving their owner's abilities), constructs are considered characters. You may acquire a construct
as a Minion, Sidekick or summoned or created by a Summon effect. Upon character creation you may also decide to be a
construct since they have a few differences from other characters as explained below.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-CONSTRUCT-CREATION">CONSTRUCT CREATION</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">Constructs are created exactly like other characters, using the guidelines in <a
href="../../secret-origins/index.html">Secret Origins</a>, with a few exceptions, discussed in the following section.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Constructs are subject to the same power level limits as other characters and the Gamemaster
should require constructs controlled by the players to observe these limits. Non-player character constructs have their
power level determined the same as other NPCs.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ABILITIES">ABILITIES</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Constructs have no Stamina, because they are not living beings. Constructs do not naturally
recover from damage; they must be repaired instead. Since being a construct has a few benefits (explained below) and no
downsides it costs 30 points to remove stamina. Stamina must be 0 before being removed (ie you can't remove it for
cheaper) and can not normally be done after character creation unless the GM allows it. Obviously not having enough
points for removing stamina means that you can't do so which makes constructs difficult to have as minions, sidekicks,
or summoned.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If the construct is not a player character then it can also be absent other abilities (see
<b>abilities</b>).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Constructs often have <a
href="../../powers/effects/effect-descriptions/immunity-defense.html">Immunities</a> (see power effects). It would be
reasonable for constructs to have these immunities: life support (7), need for sleep, and natural aging for a total of 9
points. Constructs might lack certain <b>senses</b> (see <b>senses</b>) in the form of character quirks and
<b>complications</b>, and may have <b>resistances</b> to certain things.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Due to <b>immunity</b> from effects being unbalanced and the fact that all character start out
as human and must buy (or sell) the differences, constructs have many unexpected similarities to humans. Constructs by
default are actually more like prosthetics in that they have a similar internal structure so that they are weak to the
same poisons and diseases (I know it sucks but that's the best explanation I got). It is possible for a disease or
poison to take limited to non-constructs only (assuming that is worth a point). Fortitude for constructs may instead be
in the form of an anti-virus program, the requirement for eating may be in the form of requiring a battery recharge, the
need for sleep may be in the form of disk formatting (immunities for food and sleep exist). Fatigue effects might be
overheating or low battery for those who recharge automatically (without eating) going into a power saving mode either
way. Of course looking at a zombie construct etc makes much more sense for the similarities to humans.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If you would like to have a Non-intelligent construct take that as a complication. However this
does not make you immune any effects in which case a failed Will defense check might represent hacking, simply giving it
new orders, or any other form of forcing it to do what it does not want to do. Being Non-intelligent could be entirely
role playing and have no impact at all otherwise a complication ought to do something. Being Non-intelligent does not
necessarily relate to interaction skills or (ironically) the intelligence ability or any other trait.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Like inanimate objects, a construct's Toughness rank starts out at 0 which can be increased
just like a character would (see <b>Protection</b>). Constructs also have a base Fortitude of 0.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SKILLS">SKILLS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Lacking stamina means that the character will automatically pass any stamina checks (other
defenses must still be rolled). Constructs can have skills just like characters at the same cost. However, buying
stamina based skills would be generally worthless.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ADVANTAGES">ADVANTAGES</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Constructs can have advantages at the same cost as other characters. Some advantages are less
useful or even useless to constructs.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-POWERS">POWERS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Constructs can have various power effects, like other characters. Some effects are less useful
or even useless to constructs. Power effects are often aspects of a construct's makeup or design, such as built-in armor
(<b>Protection</b>), weapons (<b>Damage</b>), or sensors (<b>Sense</b>).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-SIZE">SIZE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Constructs larger or smaller than medium must pay Character points for <b>Innate</b> and
<b>Permanent</b> <b>Growth</b> or <b>Shrinking</b>.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-COMMANDING-CONSTRUCTS">COMMANDING CONSTRUCTS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">A construct's owner can give it orders verbally or through any other means the construct
understands. Constructs follow orders to the best of their ability. Non-intelligent constructs do exactly as they're
told, without creativity or initiative, while intelligent constructs have the ability to interpret and improvise. An
owner can also give a construct a series of basic orders for it to fulfill, such as "stay and guard this place and
attack anyone who comes here other than me." In the absence of new orders, constructs follow the last order they were
given.</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-DAMAGING-AND-REPAIRING-CONSTRUCTS">DAMAGING AND REPAIRING CONSTRUCTS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">Constructs suffer damage like inanimate objects (see <b>Damage</b> effect in <a
href="../../powers/index.html">Powers</a> for details). Constructs do not naturally recover from
damage. Instead, they must be repaired. See Technology skill description for guidelines on repairing damaged
objects.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Constructs with Regeneration are self-repairing (see <b>Regeneration</b> effect in <a
href="../../powers/index.html">Powers</a>).</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-SAMPLE-CONSTRUCTS">SAMPLE CONSTRUCTS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">The following are some typical constructs, most likely to show up as a villain's minions .
Individually, they're no match for most heroes, but large numbers of them can keep characters busy and even wear them
down with a lucky attack or two.</div>
