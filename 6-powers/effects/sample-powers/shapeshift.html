<div style="padding:5px">You can transform into different forms, gaining the physical traits (abilities, skills,
advantages, and powers) of the assumed form. You gain (Shapeshift rank x 5) character points worth of traits. You are
limited to the inherent traits of the forms you assume this includes the ability to gain new mental traits if that form
possesses them.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Shapeshift uses Variable which requires a limitation such as by the specific types of forms the
character can assume, such as Limited to Animals or Limited to Machines.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Note that this example power does not include a linked <a
href="../effect-descriptions/morph-general.html">Morph</a> meaning that you do not look any different when
shapeshifting. <a href="../effect-descriptions/growth-general.html">Growth</a> and <a
href="../effect-descriptions/shrinking-general.html">Shrinking</a> on the other hand must be purchased using the
Variable points since the form you are turning into had bought them. Turning into a Hawk for example would require you
to use some of those Variable points on Shrinking since the Hawk has a permanent Shrinking. Note that there is a short
list of animals at the end of the <a href="../../../9-gamemastering.html#TOC-ANIMALS">Gamemaster page</a>.</div>
