<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="effect-general-healing">HEALING (GENERAL)</h3>
<div class="generated-class-70"><b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Close &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Instant &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 2 points per rank</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can heal wounds: removing Damage conditions from the subject and recovering HP. Make a DC 2 Healing power check,
you may heal HP equal to the difference of success, starting with the subject's worst condition, and working down, as if
the subject were recovering rapidly. You decide which conditions are the most severe but the GM may overrule. If the
subject is dying (which is the most severe) the subject first recovers 1 HP in order to stabilize.
If the Healing check fails, you must wait one
minute or use extra effort in order to try again. If you tie against the DC, instead of being a failure
the subject recovers no HP but you may try
again on the following round without penalty.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can also grant a subject a bonus equal to your Healing rank on resistance checks against
effects with disease or poison descriptors. The bonus applies to the subject's next resistance check against the
effect.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can use Healing on yourself, provided you are still capable of taking the action
required. Healing can only affect a character once between their turns (Regeneration does not count as healing for this
rule).</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Affects Objects</b>: Your Healing can also "heal" damage to objects.
You can remove damage conditions (bend, break, or destroyed) as normal and with the Regenerative modifier you can rebuild mass as normal.
Without Regenerative you must first gather the pieces to mend it (bend and break have few pieces). If you want your
healing to lose effectiveness against living subjects this modifier is free. <b>Objects Only: +0 points. Any Target: +1
cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Persistent</b>: Your Healing can remove even Incurable effects of equal or lower rank than
the number of Persistent ranks (see the Incurable modifier). If the incurable effect is higher rank than your healing
can't affect that condition at all. <b>Flat +1 point per application.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Precise</b>: You have fine control over your Healing so that you can choose what is healed
first instead of the most severe. <b>Flat +1 point.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Regenerative</b>: You can can regenerate limbs and other parts that wouldn't normally heal.
This creates new body parts (from nothing) using the current body parts as a base. There must be at least a single
living cell used as base material. First the GM determines an amount of mass missing (or volume if more appropriate).
You roll a Healing power check as normal but can substitute 1 HP of healing to regenerate half of the missing mass
thus subtracting 1 from the missing mass rank.
If the missing mass becomes rank 0 (or less) then the subject is completely regenerated. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Restorative</b>: Your Healing effect can remove afflictions. Perform a Heal power check as normal
but you can (if it is more severe) use the difference of success as a defense bonus for the subject when recovering from that affliction
instead of recovering that much HP. This defense bonus can also be used to overcome Mind Switch or Mental Transform.
For conditions that aren't afflictions: a tenderized penalty is 1 HP each
and <a href="weaken-attack.html">Weaken</a> is 1 HP per point recovered. This has no effect on Bound,
Restrained, HP conditions, and those imposed by circumstances such as a sticky floor. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Resurrection</b>: You can restore life to the dead! The body must be relatively intact
before revival is possible: all wounds will seal up but the body must be intact enough to function. A Healing power check
is required with DC equal to 10 + 3 per 5 minutes subject has been dead (rounded down with a minimum DC of 10). For example if the target
has been dead for 14 minutes then the DC is 16. If successful, the subject's HP is -2 and is stabilized. If
the check fails, you can only try again using extra effort. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Empathic</b>: When you successfully cure someone else from damage, you acquire that
damage yourself. Using this power on yourself does nothing. Area Empathic Healing is an unwise combination, as the healer
takes on all of the damage of the affected subjects at once! You can use Healing and <a
href="regeneration-defense.html">Regeneration</a> to cure your own conditions. You can have the Resurrection modifier
for Healing, but if you successfully use it, you die! This may not be as bad as it seems if you have Immortality,
allowing you to return to life (see the <a href="immortality-defense.html">Immortality</a> effect for details). <b>-1
cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Limited</b>: Examples of ways in which Healing may be Limited include: One Type of <a
href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a> (such as energy or bludgeoning damage), Objects (in conjunction with Affects
Objects), Others (you can't use Healing on yourself), or Self (you can only use Healing on yourself). <b>-1 cost per
rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Personal</b>: This modifier can only be applied if the range is close. The range is
decreased from close to personal like <b>Reduced Range</b>. This means that the effect works normally but only on
yourself. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Temporary</b>: The benefits of your Healing are temporary, lasting for one hour. The subject
then regains any damage you healed. This damage stacks with other damage the subject has acquired since the initial
healing, which may result in more severe damage or even death. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></div>
