<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="effect-defense-immunity">IMMUNITY (DEFENSE)</h3>
<div class="generated-class-70"><b>Action</b>: None &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Permanent &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point per rank</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You are immune to certain effects, automatically succeeding on any resistance check against
them. You assign ranks of Immunity to various effects to gain immunity to them (with more extensive effects requiring
more ranks). These assignments are permanent. Examples include the following:</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>1 rank</b>: natural aging, one environmental condition (natural cold, natural heat, or
vacuum), one type of suffocation (breathe normally underwater or in an alien atmosphere, for example), starvation and
thirst, need for sleep, a rare power descriptor (such as your own powers, a close sibling's powers, etc. at the GM's
discretion on whether it should instead be Resistance), Decompression sickness, or closed system (see below).</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>2 ranks</b>: suffocation effects (no need to breathe at all).</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>5 ranks</b>: sensory <a href="affliction-attack.html">Affliction</a> effects, fatigue
effects, or emotion effects (but only if you lack all emotion)</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>7 ranks</b>: life support (includes closed system (1), all environmental conditions (3), all
suffocation (2), and starvation and thirst (1)).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If you do not require sleep you may still fall asleep if you choose and this does not grant any
protection against any afflictions.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Being immune to natural heat does not protect you from natural fires, lava, smoke etc.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The reason why rare power descriptors are the only descriptors allowed is so that costumes may
be immune to your power and also some powers recognize their owner such as nano-bots that won't attack their master or
magic that can't backfire. If you want to choose other people the nano-bots won't damage use the Selective
modifier.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The GM may choose to replace natural ageing with all forms of ageing immunity (this isn't
immortality), otherwise use Resistance to Ageing Effects.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Immunity to sensory Affliction effects would be like constructs: a flash bang will not
temporarily blind them.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Immunity to fatigue effects means that to use extra effort you must spend the victory point now
or are unable to do so.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">To clarify: immunity can't be countered as long as it has permanent duration, this means that
you can't counter an immunity when it occurs unless it was a reaction.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If you'd like to have immunity from something not listed here such as motion sickness and sea
sickness (each worth 1 point) then it is probably worth 1 point but consult your GM first. You can never be immune to
anything that causes damage nor anything extremely broad such as "all viruses".</div>
<div style="padding:5px">A closed system means that poison and disease can't enter by any means including skin contact
(or battlesuit contact). No food, water, or air can enter a closed system in fact nothing can enter at all. To prevent
suffocation for a battlesuit you may wish to buy SCUBA Gear equipment for non-battlesuits this may be limited to a
single tank since switching mouth pieces would leave you temporarily susceptible. While your system is closed you may
also shut off any of your senses. To switch between opened and closed is a free action. Note that anything that pierces
into the system, including some kinds of damage, will temporarily breach (open) the system at the GM's discretion.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">There are some circumstances where a character or object will be immune to an effect such as a
sword that can't harm the pure of heart or a mental power that only works on characters who have delta brain waves. This
is a complication or limitation flaw but not immunity.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-DEGREES-OF-IMMUNITY">DEGREES OF IMMUNITY</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Some Immunity effects are a matter of degree. For example, "immunity to cold" can range from
the environmental effects of cold (described under <b>The Environment</b>) to cold damage, to complete immunity to all
effects with the "cold" descriptor. The first requires only 1 rank, and provides no resistance to other sorts of cold
effects. The second and third require <b>Resistance</b> which might provides immunity to cold <a
href="damage-attack.html">Damage</a> and all other effects with the "cold" descriptor whatever they may be but can only
handle a certain threshold.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-EXTRAS">EXTRAS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Affects Others</b>: This extra allows you to grant the benefits of your Immunity to others
by touch. It's most commonly used with life support, such as the power to maintain a life support "bubble" around you.
<b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Ranged</b>: Affects Others Immunity may have this extra, allowing it to grant its benefits
at range. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Reflect</b>: You can reflect attacks to which you are immune back at the attacker as a free
action. Make a normal attack check using your own attack modifier to hit with the reflected attack. It has its normal
effect if it hits. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Redirect</b>: You can redirect attacks to which are you are immune at any other target
within the attack's normal range, as Reflect, above. You must have the Reflect extra to take this one. <b>+1 cost per
rank.</b></div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">FREE MODIFIERS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Sustained</b>: Sustained duration Immunity may be suitable for certain types of powers,
particularly force fields or similar protective abilities requiring a modicum of concentration. It is a net +0 modifier
from Immunity's base permanent duration.</div>
<h4 class="generated-class-56" id="TOC-FLAWS">FLAWS</h4>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Limited to Half Effect</b>: You suffer half the normal effect rather than being entirely
immune to it. For environmental effects, you only make checks half as often. For other effects, halve the effect's rank
(round down) before determining its resistance check DC, including for things like Impervious. <b>-1 cost per
rank.</b></div>
