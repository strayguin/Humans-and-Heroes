<div class="page-header-red">ABILITIES</div>
<div style="font-size:16px">
<div style="padding:5px">Everyone has certain basic <b>abilities</b>: how strong, fast, smart, and clever they are.
These abilities influence most things your character does. Stronger characters can lift greater weights, more agile
characters have better balance, tougher characters can soak up more damage, and so forth.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">All characters have eight basic abilities: <b>Strength</b> (<b>Str</b>), <b>Stamina</b>
(<b>Sta</b>), <b>Dexterity</b> (<b>Dex</b>), <b>Agility</b> (<b>Agl</b>), <b>Fighting</b> (<b>Ftg</b>), <b>Intellect</b>
(<b>Int</b>), <b>Awareness</b> (<b>Awe</b>), and <b>Presence</b> (<b>Pre</b>). Strength, Dexterity, Agility and Stamina
are <b>physical abilities</b>, whereas Fighting, Intellect, Awareness, and Presence are <b>mental abilities</b>. Each
above-average ability provides a bonus on certain dice rolls; while below average abilities apply a penalty.</div>
<div class="blue-box-header">ABILITY RANKS</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Each ability has a <b>rank</b> associated with it, based on how above or below average it is.
Abilities start at rank 0, the baseline average for an adult human being. Abilities can't go below -5 but, aside from
power level limitations, there is no upper limit.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">The ability rank is added to, or subtracted from, the sum of a dice roll when your character
does something related to that ability. For example, your Strength rank affects the amount of damage you do when
punching someone. Your Intellect rank comes into play when you roll skills based on Intellect, and so forth. Sometimes
your rank is used to calculate another value, such as when you use your Agility to determine how good you are at
avoiding harm with your reflexes (your Dodge defense).</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-BUYING-ABILITY-RANKS">BUYING ABILITY RANKS</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">You choose your hero's ability ranks by spending character points on them. Increasing an
ability rank by 1 costs 2 character points, so putting 4 points into Dexterity, for example, raises it from 0 to 2.
Remember a rank of 0 is average (See <b>Table: Ability Benchmarks</b>.)</div>

<div style="padding:5px">Although a rank of 3 is defined as "the peak of human achievement" in an ability on <b>Table:
Ability Benchmarks</b>, a character with an ability rank greater than 3 isn't necessarily "non-human," merely superhuman
in comparison to ordinary people. Many "normal human" characters in the comics have superhuman abilities, particularly
mental abilities. A character can have a superhuman ability rank without necessarily being anything other than an
amazingly talented, well-trained human being. The limits of what "normal" people can accomplish is up to the Gamemaster
and depends very much on the style of the game.</div>

<div style="padding:5px">You can also lower one or more of your character's ability ranks from the starting value of 0.
Each rank you lower an ability gives you an additional 2 character points to spend elsewhere. You cannot lower an
ability rank below -5, which is itself a serious deficiency.</div>

<div class="blue-box-header">THE ABILITIES</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Here are descriptions of the eight abilities and what they represent.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-STRENGTH-STR-">STRENGTH (STR)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Strength measures sheer muscle power and the ability to apply it. It gives you the ability to
move anything that is physical.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Your Strength rank applies to:</div>
<div style="padding:5px">
<ul>
<li>Damage dealt by your unarmed and strength-based attacks.</li>
<li>How far you can jump (based on an Athletics skill check).</li>
<li>The amount of weight you can lift, carry, and throw.</li>
<li>Athletics skill checks.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-STAMINA-STA-">STAMINA (STA)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Stamina is health, endurance, and overall physical resilience. Stamina is important because it
affects a character's ability to resist most forms of damage.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Your Stamina modifier applies to:</div>
<div style="padding:5px">
<ul>
<li>Toughness defense, for resisting damage.</li>
<li>Fortitude defense, for resisting effects targeting your character's health.</li>
<li>Stamina checks to resist or recover from things affecting your character's health when a specific defense doesn't apply. Such as Fatigue from a forced march.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-AGILITY-AGL-">AGILITY (AGL)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Agility is balance, grace, speed, and overall physical coordination. It gives you the ability
to move.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Your Agility rank applies to:</div>
<div style="padding:5px">
<ul>
<li>Dodge defense, for avoiding ranged attacks and other hazards.</li>
<li>Initiative bonus, for acting first in combat.</li>
<li>Acrobatics and Stealth skill checks.</li>
<li>Agility checks for feats of coordination, gross movement, and quickness when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DEXTERITY-DEX-">DEXTERITY (DEX)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Dexterity is a measure of hand-eye coordination, precision, and manual dexterity. It gives you
the ability to manipulate objects.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Your Dexterity rank applies to:</div>
<div style="padding:5px">
<ul>
<li>Attack checks for ranged attacks.</li>
<li>Sleight of Hand and Vehicles skill checks.</li>
<li>Dexterity checks for feats of fine control and precision when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-FIGHTING-FGT-">FIGHTING (FGT)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Fighting measures your character's ability in close combat, from hitting a target to ducking
and weaving around any counter-attacks. It gives you the ability to manipulate your own body.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Your Fighting rank applies to:</div>
<div style="padding:5px">
<ul>
<li>Attack checks for close attacks.</li>
<li>Parry defense, for avoiding close attacks.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-INTELLECT-INT-">INTELLECT (INT)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Intellect covers reasoning ability, learning, memory and knowledge. A character with a high
Intellect rank tends to be knowledgeable and well-educated.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Your Intellect modifier applies to:</div>
<div style="padding:5px">
<ul>
<li>Expertise, Investigation, Technology, and Treatment skill checks.</li>
<li>Intellect checks to solve problems using sheer brain-power when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-AWARENESS-AWE-">AWARENESS (AWE)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">While Intellect covers reasoning, Awareness describes common sense and intuition, what some
might call "wisdom." A character with a high Intellect and a low Awareness may be an "absentminded professor" type,
smart but not always aware of what's going on. On the other hand, a not so bright (low Intellect) character may have
great deal of common sense (high Awareness). Simply put it is your ability to sense what is going on.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Your Awareness modifier applies to:</div>
<div style="padding:5px">
<ul>
<li>Insight and Perception skill checks.</li>
<li>Awareness checks to resolve matters of intuition when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-PRESENCE-PRE-">PRESENCE (PRE)</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Presence is force of personality, persuasiveness, and leadership ability. Presence is useful
for heroes who intend to be leaders as well as those who strike fear into the hearts of criminals with their presence.
Since this includes leadership it is also to a lesser degree charisma and attractiveness.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Your Presence modifier applies to:
<ul>
<li>Will defense, for resisting attacks on your mind.</li>
<li>Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion skill checks.</li>
<li>Presence checks to influence others through force of personality when a specific skill doesn't apply.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="blue-box-header">ENHANCED ABILITIES</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Some ability ranks--or portions of them--may be acquired as <b>Enhanced Traits</b>, as
described in <a href="powers/index.html">Powers</a>. Enhanced Abilities are superhuman powers rather than natural. The key
differences between Enhanced Abilities and normal ability ranks are Enhanced Abilities can be nullified (normal
abilities cannot, see <b>Nullify</b>) and Enhanced Abilities can have power modifiers and be used for power stunts with
extra effort (normal abilities cannot, see <b>Extra Effort</b>).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Enhanced Abilities and normal abilities have the same cost (2 character points per +1 ability
rank). The player decides if a character's ability rank is normal or enhanced and, if it is enhanced, how much of it is
enhanced.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-SUPER-STRENGTH-AND-SPEED">SUPER STRENGTH AND SPEED</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Super strength and super speed are common super powers. The obvious way to do this is put many
ranks into Strength and Agility but this is too expensive and high Agility does not act as super speed. For super
strength buy things like <b>Power Lifting</b>, <b>Leaping</b>, and <b>Damage</b> (Strength-based). For super speed buy
things like <b>Improved Initiative</b> (likely as an <b>Enhanced Trait</b>), <b>Quickness</b>, and <b>Ground Speed</b>.
For your convenience there are example power packages for <a
href="powers/effects/sample-powers/super-strength.html">Super-Strength</a> and <a
href="powers/effects/sample-powers/super-speed.html">Super-Speed</a> see them for details.</div>
<div class="blue-box-header">ALTERING ABILITIES</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Over the course of play, your hero's ability ranks may change for the following reasons: being
affected by a power effect that raises or lowers ability ranks (see <a href="powers/index.html">Powers</a>) or by spending
character points.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">You can improve ability ranks permanently by spending earned character points on them, but you
cannot increase an ability rank above the limits set by the series' power level (see <b>Power Level</b>).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Whenever an ability rank changes, all traits associated with the ability change as well. So if
you increase your character's Agility, his Agility-based skills and Dodge defense also increase. Likewise, if the hero's
Agility bonus decreases, his Agility-based skills and Dodge suffer.</div>
<div class="blue-box-header">DEBILITATED ABILITIES</div>
<div style="padding:5px">If one of your hero's ability ranks drops below -5 for any reason, that ability is said to be
<b>debilitated</b> and you suffer more serious effects than just a penalty. You automatically fail any rolls related to
that ability including attacks and defense checks. Other effects are as follows:</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Debilitated <b>Strength</b> means you fall prone and are Paralyzed (defenseless, immobilized,
and physically stunned, although still conscious and aware).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Debilitated <b>Stamina</b> means the hero is dying, and suffers a -5 modifier on Fortitude
checks to avoid death on top of it. This is independent of HP and you are not incapacitated or even dazed. You can't
stabilize until your Stamina has recovered.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Debilitated <b>Dexterity</b>: you drop everything you are holding, can't use fingers or other
fine motor skills, and your punches deal 1 less damage.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Debilitated <b>Agility</b>: you are Paralyzed (defenseless, immobilized, and physically
stunned) although you don't fall prone.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Debilitated <b>Fighting</b>: you are physically stunned.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Debilitated <b>Intellect</b>: due to having no knowledge or memory you don't know who anyone
is, what you are doing or why. Some complications will subconsciously remain influencing your actions. You might as well
be stunned unless someone can convince you to act. You suffer as if your Intellect was absent (see below).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Debilitated <b>Awareness</b> means the hero is unaware and remains so until restored to at
least a -5 rank in the ability.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Debilitated <b>Presence</b>: you are no longer able to control your character (it is now controlled by the GM).
The character will retain complications and opinions but will do as they are told. See absent Presence below.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Debilitated ability ranks result from a power affecting your character (see <b>Weaken</b>).
Ability ranks cannot be lowered any further once they are debilitated. The side effects of a debilitated ability are similar
to temporarily having an absent ability (the exception being Stamina which is opposite).</div>
<div class="blue-box-header">ABSENT ABILITIES</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Rather than having a rank of -5 in a given ability, some things or creatures actually lack an
ability altogether. These beings automatically fail any check requiring the absent ability except Stamina which
automatically passes. The additional effects of an absent ability are as follows:</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Strength</b>: A creature with no Strength is incapable of exerting any physical force,
either because it has no physical form (like an incorporeal ghost) or simply can't move (like a tree). A character
without Strength also has no Dexterity and no Fighting.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Stamina</b>: A creature with no Stamina has no physical body (like a ghost) or is not a
living being (such as a robot or other construct). Creatures with no Stamina recover but not necessarily suffer from
damage like inanimate objects (see <b>Damaging Objects</b> under the <b>Damage</b> effect). Creatures with no Stamina
are often--but not necessarily--immune to many of the other things affecting living beings as well (see
<b>Immunity</b>). Stamina checks automatically pass unlike other absent abilities.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Dexterity</b>: A creature with no Dexterity cannot manipulate objects including devices.
This might be because of a lack of hand equivalents such as a bulldozer or steamroller having strength but are not able
to use objects. Characters with Dexterity must also have Strength and Fighting.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Agility</b>: A creature with no Agility is unable to move its body under its own power and
has no Dodge defense (always fails). These beings can't have most forms of movement and are permanently Immobile. If
this character has the ability to take actions then it can roll initiative as though its Agility was 0.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Fighting</b>: A creature with no Fighting is incapable of manipulating its own body and thus
unable to make any sort of close attack. The exception is agility: these characters can still move themselves if they
have agility. Characters with Fighting must also have Strength. Characters without Fighting can't have Dexterity since
you must be able to manipulate your body in order to manipulate objects.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Intellect</b>: A creature with no Intellect has no Knowledge or Memory beyond surface
thoughts: the instant something is not being thought about it is forgotten. Due to their inability to gain experience, a
character without Intelligence can only grow physically and will not be able to buy or use most skills at the GM's discretion.
This also limits the available advantages.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Awareness</b>: Anything with no Awareness is completely unaware and it can't have any
senses. It is immune to interaction skills.</div>
<div style="padding:5px"><b>Presence</b>: A creature with no Presence is an automaton, lacking free will and operating
entirely on commands given. It is still affected by interaction skills (in fact the skill always passes) and it
automatically fails Will defense checks. It can't use any interaction skills and will always follow any command given to
the best of its ability with some exceptions. It often has criteria to decide how to handle a conflict of commands or to
only accept commands from certain people. The only decisions it is allowed to make are those involved with completing a
command given.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Here's a quick visual reference for dependency:
<ul>
   <li>Independent: Stamina (living), Agility (mobility), Intellect (knowledge and memory), Awareness (senses), and Presence (personality and free will).</li>
   <li>Strength: have the ability to move anything that is physical
      <ul>
          <li>Fighting: have the ability to move physically any part of themselves and thus must be physical
            <ul>
                <li>Dexterity: the ability to manipulate objects by using their physical body</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ul>
Usually anything that has Agility but not Strength means that it is non-physical and it has the ability to move.
</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Lacking an ability is -10 character points; that is, it gives the character an additional 10
character points to spend elsewhere, similar to having a -5 rank in an ability, but with different effects. The
exception is Stamina which costs 30 points to lack. Abilities must be rank 0 before removing it. Players are not allowed
to be absent any ability except Stamina (see <b>constructs</b>).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Absent abilities cannot be weakened (see <b>Weaken</b>) or debilitated, since they are not
present at all in the first place!</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Non-living inanimate objects lack everything except Toughness. Living inanimate objects
(plants) also have Stamina and Fortitude. Animate, but nonliving, constructs such as robots or zombies may be missing
any of the abilities depending on what it is designed to do (if it isn't a player character) but will always be missing
Stamina (by definition of non-living). See <b>Constructs</b>.</div>
<div class="blue-box-header">DEFENSES &amp; INITIATIVE</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Heroes face many hazards in their line of work, from attacks by villainous foes to traps and
fiendish mind control. A hero's <b>defenses</b> are abilities used to avoid such things, determining the difficulty to
affect a hero with an attack, or to make resistance checks against them. Each defense is based on a particular ability,
modified by the hero's advantages and powers. For more on defenses in general and how you use them, see <a
href="action-adventure.html#TOC-RESISTANCE">Action &amp; Adventure</a>.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Note that unlike ability scores, nothing special happens if a defense drops to 0 or below.
While toughness has no lower limit (because there is no maximum limit to the number of tenderized penalties),
all other defense have an effective minimum of -7. <a href="powers/effects/effect-descriptions/weaken-attack.html">Weaken</a>
can't reduce a defense below 0 but can reduce the related ability
to -5, combined with the disabled condition makes -7.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-DODGE">DODGE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Dodge defense is based on Agility rank. It includes reaction time, quickness, nimbleness, and
overall coordination, used to avoid ranged attacks or other hazards where reflexes and speed are important.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-FORTITUDE">FORTITUDE</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Fortitude defense is based on Stamina and measures health and resistance to threats like poison
or disease. It incorporates constitution, ruggedness, metabolism, and immunity.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-PARRY">PARRY</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Parry defense is based on Fighting. It is the ability to counter, duck, or otherwise evade a
foe's attempts to strike you in close combat through superior fighting ability. Note that Parry never provides a counter
attack for balance reasons.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-TOUGHNESS">TOUGHNESS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Toughness defense is based on Stamina and is resistance to direct damage or harm, and overall
durability.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-WILL">WILL</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Will defense is based on Presence rank. It measures mental stability, level-headedness,
determination, self-confidence, self-awareness, and willpower, used to resist mental or spiritual attacks.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-DEFENSE-RANK">DEFENSE RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Your base defense ranks are equal to your ranks in their associated abilities. You can increase
your defenses above the values granted by your ability ranks by spending character points: 1 character point grants you
an additional rank in a defense, up to the limits imposed by power level (see <b>Power Level</b>).</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Defense Cost = 1 character points per +1 rank</div>
<div style="padding:5px">With the Enhanced Trait effect (see <a href="powers/index.html">Powers</a>) you can also improve
your defenses with powers at the same cost, 1 point per rank.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-TOUGHNESS-RANK">TOUGHNESS RANK</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">The exception is Toughness, which can only be increased above your base Stamina rank using
advantages and powers, not by direct spending of character points. This reflects that greater-than-normal Toughness is
virtually always some sort of special ability. See <b>Advantages</b> and <a href="powers/index.html">Powers</a> for various
options for improving Toughness, notably the <b>Defensive Roll</b> advantage and the <b>Protection</b> effect.</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-ACTIVE-DEFENSES">ACTIVE DEFENSES</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Dodge and Parry defenses require a measure of action to be fully effective. Limits on your
mobility, focus, and reaction time adversely affect them. The conditions vulnerable and defenseless affect your active
defenses (see <a href="the-basics/conditions.html">Conditions</a> for description).</div>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-RESISTANCE-CHECKS">RESISTANCE CHECKS</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Defenses are also used to measure the ability to overcome certain effects, involving a
<b>resistance check</b> of the defense plus a dice roll against a difficulty class determined by the effect or hazard.
So you might make a Parry resistance check for your hero to avoid a sword thrust by a villain, for example, or a Dodge
resistance check to evade a trap just as it is triggered, and so on. This is referred to as "resisting," such as
"resisted by Fortitude" or "resisted by Dodge".</div>
<h2 style="font-size:28px" id="TOC-INITIATIVE">INITIATIVE</h2>
<div style="padding:5px">When things start happening quickly, characters use their <b>initiative</b> bonuses to
determine who goes first. Each character involved in a conflict makes a check of 3dF + initiative modifier, which
is:</div>
<div class="generated-class-5">Initiative Modifier = Agility + Advantages (Improved Initiative) + Power Modifiers</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Characters then act in initiative order, from highest to lowest. For details see <a
href="action-adventure.html">Action &amp; Adventure</a>.</div>
