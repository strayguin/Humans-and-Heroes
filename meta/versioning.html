<p>This is version 3.<script type="text/javascript">document.write(latestMinorVersion);</script>.
The most recent stable version of the system is located
<a href="http://skyspiral7.github.io/Humans-and-Heroes/">online here</a>. Or click
<a href="https://github.com/SkySpiral7/Humans-and-Heroes/archive/gh-pages.zip">here to download a copy</a>.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-VERSION-NUMBERING-SCHEME">VERSION NUMBERING SCHEME</h3>
<p>The whole number is the major version number (which is currently 3). The number after the decimal point is the minor
version number (which is currently <script type="text/javascript">document.write(latestMinorVersion);</script>).
These version numbers are not based on <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>.
The major version number is incremented whenever there is a change to the game as a whole: such as a change in core mechanics,
a change is philosophy or meaning for a major game concept, or other major widespread changes or overhaul.
The minor version number is incremented whenever there is a change in any rule that affects how the game is played
or anything that affects the <a href="../secret-origins/point-counter.html">point calculator</a>.
Things such as renaming a term, changing the website color scheme, or rewording for clarification do not cause the minor
number to change. Changing an example hero under the "Secret Origins" sidebar (aka Hero Archetypes) will change the minor
version number since those are expected to be used as-is but changing any other example will not change the version.
Changing anything in the Meta section of pages will also not change the version number since it isn't changing any rules.
(Major version 2 only incremented the minor version number whenever I gave a copy to someone
which is why the last minor number is so low at 2.7.)</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-MAJOR-VERSION-HISTORY">MAJOR VERSION HISTORY</h3>
<p>Since each major version is something the players must agree upon here's a list of the major versions:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is a placeholder version which represents the Open Game Content of Mutants and Masterminds 3rd edition.</li>
<li>This version makes many balancing changes and adds more to the game. The big decision for players for whether or not
to use this version is the change in ownership. While I do believe my game is better, I don't have a team of people
and I haven't even play tested it yet. If you decide to use H&amp;H you'll have to make sure everyone knows the rules
(since this is effectively homebrew) and accept that any M&amp;M material can't be used without conversion.</li>
<li>The core mechanic uses 3 fudge dice instead of a 20 sided die. This change focuses on character traits instead
of luck. Any high trait will be very useful because the dice have little variance, however this also means any very low
trait is effectively useless. This forces more focus on character creation since mistakes are much more grave (perhaps literally).
Combat traits need particular attention since being too low may result in 1-sided combat, for more information
see <a href="../secret-origins/index.html#TOC-WEAK-PLAYER-CHARACTERS">Weak Player Characters</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-FOR-GIT-USERS">FOR GIT USERS</h3>
<p>Feel free to make a pull request but I will not give you push permission.</p>
<p>So basically this repository is a tabletop game forked from the Open Game Content portions of Mutants and Masterminds
3rd edition (see below). Which is legal (see <a href="../open-game-license.html">Open Game License</a> for details).
Individual commits are intentionally invisible to the average player. Commits that change the version number will
have their commit message start with the new version number. Since the changes are available online right away I
consider this to be continuous integration into prod which is why I don't bother tagging anything since I expect many
minor version changes and for no one to need any tags.</p>
<p>The gh-pages branch has the most recent stable rules and should be the one used when playing the game.
If any other branch exists it will likely be for H&amp;H 4.0 and will be in alpha until merged into gh-pages.
Also note that if a 4a branch exists it will likely be the only one maintained.</p>
<p>If you discover an html file that isn't linked to by any page then it exists for reference and doesn't contain
actual game rules.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ORIGIN-OWNERSHIP-AND-LEGALITY">ORIGIN, OWNERSHIP, AND LEGALITY</h3>
<p>This website is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game_License" target="_blank">Open Game
Content</a> portions of the 3rd Edition of the <b>Mutants and Masterminds</b> Superhero Roleplaying Game by <a
href="http://www.greenronin.com/" target="_blank">Green Ronin Publishing</a>. Humans &amp; Heroes (this system) is likewise free to use.</p>
<p>This website was originally copied from <a href="http://www.d20herosrd.com">www.d20herosrd.com</a> using the tool <a
href="http://www.httrack.com/">HTTrack</a> in 2012, the original website has since changed to include other free info that isn't M&amp;M.
After making the copy I modified it under the new name Humans &amp; Heroes. The original site is owned by <a
href="mailto:jreyst@gmail.com">John Reyst</a> and the modifications were done by <a
href="mailto:rworcest@g.emporia.edu">Ryan Worcester</a>. Also note that every image has been copied from the original
website, I do not have permission to copy the CSS or images
but I assume there aren't any copyright issues since it was a publicly viewed website. All images that are links
(although often broken) go to who owns the image (all of them are <a href="http://stornart.com/">http://stornart.com/</a>
or <a href="http://opengameart.org/">http://opengameart.org/</a>).</p>
<p>The CSS does say "Copyright 2012 Google Inc. All Rights Reserved." but I assume it's ok since I retained that
notice and stripped out around 90% of it. Additionally <a href="http://sites.google.com/">Google Sites</a> is free to
use (since I have a gmail) even though I did remove the page footer with that info. Open Game Art <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/faq#q-purpose">states</a>
that I can use the art for free (even if I can't prove the images came from there because of dead links).
Storn Art on the other hand I don't know. Since the website is a Blog by Storn A. Cook I might not actually have permission.</p>
<p>Note that because H&amp;H is based on M&amp;M and M&amp;M was written for superheroes, H&amp;H is also written with
superheroes in mind. However all references to comic books, superheroes, ect is superficial because H&amp;H can support
ALL characters, themes, and genres minus <a href="known-issues.html">known limitations</a>.</p>
