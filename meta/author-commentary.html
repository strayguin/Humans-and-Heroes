<p>This page is where I rambled on about junk.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-8" id="TOC-ABOUT-RULES">ABOUT RULES</h3>
<p>"Must we have rules? Can't we just play?" You could but I wouldn't (obviously otherwise I wouldn't be writing this
up). There are reasons why you might want rules and reasons why you don't want rules and here are the 2 lists that I
came up with.</p>
<p>Please note that the number of reasons does not necessarily mean they are equal: I believe that the reasons for
having rules are vastly superior to those against having rules.</p>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-REASONS-FOR-RULES">REASONS FOR RULES</h3>
<ol>
   <li>For people who love rules of course but this reason doesn't count.<p>Such as myself.</p></li>
   <li>Convenient balancing.<p>Suppose a joining player is trying to make a balanced character: "Does this look fine to you?" GM: "Did you follow the rules?" player: "Yes" GM: "Then I don't even need to look at it and I know it is balanced (in comparison to the other players)". Another thing is that rules may limit or call attention to certain potent combinations so that a power gamer (aka power player) can't easily break the balance without cheating. This also means that certain combinations that the GM wouldn't notice have already been covered. Of course the GM should still look over the character sheet especially in this game which has a few things that only the GM can balance</p></li>
   <li>Convenient quantitative mechanics.<p>Player 1: "my character has super speed" Player 2: "so does mine except I'm faster" P1: "the heck you are: anything you can do I can do better". Who is faster? Well if you have no quantity to represent speed then there is no way of knowing (most likly they would be deemed the same speed and a race would boil down to a dice roll). But using rules you can instead buy a certain number of ranks which also addresses the question of "exactly how fast am I?"</p></li>
   <li>It's possible to write down and pass around which also allows profit.<p>Obviously it isn't possible to write a book about a game system that doesn't use books but having rules provides something that can be passed around (electronically or otherwise). FYI: I do not intend to make money off of this.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="generated-class-3" id="TOC-REASONS-AGAINST-RULES">REASONS AGAINST RULES</h3>
<ol>
   <li>For people who hate rules of course but this reason doesn't count.<p>Listed here for the same reason as the first reason of the previous list.</p></li>
   <li>Bringing in new people is easy since there is nothing to read up on.<p>"I've never played this before and I want to join, tell me what I need to know and what I need to do". Instead of handing the player a book and tell them to come back tomorrow, you can sit down and explain everything in what shouldn't take more than an hour.</p></li>
   <li>Easy to remember (or perhaps unnecessary to remember).<p>Player: "I don't remember how we handled navigation at sea last time" GM: "for you roll 1d20 and get at least a 5" There is no need to look up rules on how to handle situations since the GM controls the mechanics.</p></li>
   <li>Unlimited versatility.<p>Player: "since I'm a monkey can I stand on my head and (or sit down) and using these swords attack 4 times in one turn?" GM: "Sure why not... If you use your tail that makes 5 times." Although this example would normally be extremely unbalanced (depending on the situation), it is obviously possible to do anything the GM can imagine (if the GM can't imagine it then the player will have to explain it more).</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="generated-class-8">Metaphysics Rant</h3>
<div style="padding:5px">Notice that it is impossible for anyone to alter any meta level above themselves. For example a
person in real life can't alter real life physics because real life physics have authority over them, if he was to
overcome physics by shear willpower then that means he has ascended to a higher meta level, and for this to even be
possible physics would have to allow it unless his willpower was already at a higher meta level. Also note that the
numbering I gave to the meta levels in the table above is arbitrary and meaningless. This table does not have every
possible meta level since numbers below 0 exist, such as if the character plays a game (within a game), and also notice
that the table doesn't include governmental hierarchy (which would exist entirely in level 3) etc.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Characters are by default at meta level 0. Characters with the power <b>Reality Warp</b> are at
meta level 1 because they can change Physics and are not controlled by it. Characters with the advantage <b>Beyond
Mortal</b> are somewhere between 0 and 1 since they are unaffected by physics yet can't change them or more accurately
they are meta level 1 but are prevented from changing anything by meta level 3 (the Gamemaster). Characters with the
power <b>Alter Metaphysics</b> are at meta level 2 since they can control the game rules and are not governed by
them.</div>
<div style="padding:5px">Players are always at least 1 meta level above their character. Characters have a maximum meta
level of 2 and players have a maximum of 3 (which would also make them a Gamemaster). Although players do have the
ability to control characters other then their own, the Gamemaster does not give them the authority to do so. Each level
must obey (is not able to disobey) every rule of every level above them and each level has control over all levels below
them and some control over the same level. Each meta level must agree for example there can't be a rule that says there
is no gravity and a rule that says there is: one must replace the other.</div>
